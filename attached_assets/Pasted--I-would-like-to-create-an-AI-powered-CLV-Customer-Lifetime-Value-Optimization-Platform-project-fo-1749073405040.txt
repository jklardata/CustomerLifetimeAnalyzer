I would like to create an AI-powered CLV (Customer Lifetime Value) Optimization Platform project for Shopify businesses, I just created the Shopify test store. Now I want to start setting up a new project and the development environment that will connect to the Shopify API to fetch orders, order_items, customers, abandoned carts, and returns and use python to connect. 

The goal is to be able to Forecast CLV Using Purchase Frequency, Cart Abandonment Rates, and Product Return Patterns based on the data in shopify partner's stores.

Objective: Have a simple front-end website with a description of the CLV platform (based on the same description from clv.klardata.com), where it allows a user to enter their Shopify credentials.

Once they are logged in and authenticated, they will land on new page which shows a basic dashboard with aggregated metrics for Orders, Returns, Abandoned Cart Rates, Purchase order frequency, number of customers, etc. From there they can also disconnect their shopify account and it will go back to the login/landing page with a message saying they have logged out.

AI-powered CLV optimization platform with improvements and implementation Approach:

Technical Architecture Improvements
1. Security Enhancements

Environment Variables: Store credentials in Replit's secrets manager instead of hardcoding
OAuth Implementation: Use Shopify's OAuth flow instead of basic credentials
Role-Based Access: Use Supabase's Row Level Security with service_role key only for backend operations

2. Data Pipeline Optimization
# Sample async data fetcher using ShopifyAPI
async def fetch_shopify_data(resource):
    with shopify.Session(shop_url, api_version, token):
        return shopify.ShopifyResource.find(resource, limit=250)

Implement pagination for large datasets
Add incremental sync instead of full refresh
Use webhooks for real-time updates

3. CLV Calculation Framework

def calculate_clv(customers):
    return (avg_order_value * purchase_frequency) * 
           customer_lifespan * (1 - return_rate)[4]


Replit Setup Guide
--
1. Project Structure

/frontend
  - templates/
  - static/
/backend
  - shopify_integration.py
  - supabase_client.py
  - clv_calculator.py
requirements.txt
.replit

2. .replit Configuration

run = "flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8080"
[environment]
PYTHONPATH = "/home/runner/${REPL_SLUG}"

3. requirements.txt
flask==3.0.0
shopify==9.0.0
supabase==2.3.1
pandas==2.0.3

Key Implementation Steps
--

1. Shopify API Integration
def shopify_auth():
    session = shopify.Session(shop_url, API_VERSION)
    scope = ['read_orders', 'read_customers']
    return shopify.OAuth.authorize_url(scope)

2. Supabase Data Model

CREATE TABLE shopify_data (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  store_id TEXT,
  data_type TEXT,
  raw_data JSONB,
  processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ
);

3. Predictive Analytics Engine

def predict_clv(df):
    X = df[['order_count', 'avg_order_value', 'return_rate']]
    model = RandomForestRegressor()
    model.fit(X, df['total_spend'])
    return model.predict(X)


Error Handling Recommendations
1.Implement automatic retries for API calls
2.Add connection pooling for Supabase
3.Use Sentry/Rollbar integration for error monitoring
4.Add rate limiting protection

Deployment Checklist
1.Set up GitHub integration in Replit
2.Configure secrets in Replit environment
3.Enable Supabase database backups
4.Implement health check endpoint
5.Add automated test suite

Shopify Info:
You can use the test store i created at clv-test-store.myshopify.com to test
- Shopify API Credentials: 
    - API Key: 2f36743ed6c2d9f863ca7abf6ff2a895

This should be a simple app for a PoC for now.
